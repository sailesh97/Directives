Understanding Directives

Attribute Directives:
They're called so because they sit on HTML Elements just like attributes.

Structural Directives:
Though Structural Directives also sit on HTML Elements, they're named so because 
they are responsible for structure of the DOM.

If *ngIf = false, that element is removed from the DOM, not hidden, it's removed.
