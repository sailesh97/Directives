<!-- 

  ngClass is a directive

  [ngClass]= "{cssClassName: any statement/method/conditon that resolves to a boolean value }"

  The square bracket around ngClass here denotes that we're binding to some property on our ngClass directive.

  ngClass expects an object (within double quotes), where the key is the css class name and it's value is a Javascript statement, method or anything that at the end resolves to a boolean value.

 -->

 <!--

  ngStyle is another in-built directive.

  Syntax: [ngStyle] = "{backgroundColor: odd % 2 !== 0 ? 'yellow' : 'transparent'}"

  ngStyle also expects an object (within double quotes), where the key is an css style property and like ngClass it's value can also be set dynamically through a function call, or Javascript statement
  and the value depends on what css style property you have used. Here a string (that's a color value).
